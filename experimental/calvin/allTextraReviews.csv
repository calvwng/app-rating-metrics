I just wish pictures I receive by MMS would show on my Android Wear device but it just shows a card telling me I have received a picture and I then need to view on phone,Wish you would add better support for Android Wear,en,,,,,14831371782,Love the textra app. I first started looking for a better texting app in 2014 due to the lag that is present in the default messaging app that was on my Note 4.

The only issue is that the audio file player is terrible. If you move your phone, send a text, deliver a text, receive a text, or scroll down too far, the audio stops. And you CAN'T RESUME or play the audio from the middle, it always starts from the beginning, and if you get interrupted at all, youll have to play it from the beginning again.

Unfortunately still searching for the ""perfect"" SMS app since I can't assign an external app like WavPlayer to play MMS audio files. I get all my VMs as MMS attachments and the built in player only plays audio through the external speaker, which makes it hard to hear when its noisy and you lose any privacy in listening. Also no scrubber so if you need to try to replay a number again, you have to listen to the whole message.",4.00,Awesome,3.7,0

So far, loving this app and glad I decided to give this one a try. Simple and easy to use but has lots of features if you want to customize. I mainly downloaded this app to group my group messages together. Handcent was inconsistent with that, sometimes it would reply to a group text as separate messages to everyone. Textra works all the time and I can easily customize ringtones for specific contacts.
