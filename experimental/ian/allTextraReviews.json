Simple is what I want. I don't need an SMS app to access every aspect of my social life. I don't want it to ask me for my G+/FB account info every other time I log in.Textra does its job with little or no setup time BUT! if you want to customize it, then it has easy to use options/add-ons. Yes, it used to be free/ad-free - now its not. But with the amount of attention the coding team puts into this application, a couple of bucks is worth it to me. Keep in mind this was one of the first SMS applications that locked down and prevented the 'Stagefright' exploit. Literally 24 hours after the exploit was publicly announced, Textra had a patch. I'm STILL waiting on samsung/google/verizon to release an update for my device that will eliminate that exploit.",
